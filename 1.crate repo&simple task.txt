git remote add origin https://github.com/skhade007/localrepo.git #connection establish local and remote.
 git remote -v #to check remote
                    origin  https://github.com/skhade007/localrepo.git (fetch)
                    origin  https://github.com/skhade007/localrepo.git (push)
git remote rename origin mmyname #rename origin to myname 
 git remote -v #to check remote

                    myname  https://github.com/skhade007/localrepo.git (push)
git branch #to check which branch
  * master
git branch -M main #rename  master branch main because hub branch name is also main thats why we can also try to master but that tym hub name also changed as amaster.
 git branch        
  * main
git push origin main #######data sucessfully save in hub repo########
after that we can also create new file in that folder and try to push successfully(ex: create one file in same folder and try to push in hub)
