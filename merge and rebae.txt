push- on hub repo atleast one commit or fille required.
git branch
  * feature1
    main
ls #see which files in feature1 branch
#when we create undefined file this file show all branches after commit see only particular branch.


assigmnt2:create branches and try to merge hub and local:
git branch feature1 #create one branch and here data is same as main branch also use or #git checkout -b feature1 #create and automatically navigate.
  feature1
git checkout feature1 #go to feature1 branch
git branch
  * feature1
    main
# current branch not deleted,first checkout the another branch then delete(create one feature2 branch and try to delete as mention below)
git branch -d feature2 #featrue2 branch deleted
git branch
  * feature1
    main
do changes on feature1 branch # then we can change branch main and see there is no data available same as feature branch.
git status
git add and commit.
git push origin feature1 # push this branch to hub
#here is hub shows feature and main branch but not merge, now try to merge on hub first
git branch
  * feature1
    main
git diff main #see difrence in branches,when we are in feature1 branch that tym is run

Two ways to merge: 
1)for hub merge branches using PR(pull request)
 #try to merge in github using compare and pull request option then pull on local machine,after pull/merge both branch data is same.
#in hub both branch are merge after the PR but local machine still both branch not merge 
git pull origin main #remote changes on local machie now hub and local code is same.
2)for local
git branch
* feature1
    main
git merge main# used to merge branches in local mashine and then push on hub.if * feature1 then merge main.
