git remote add origin https://github.com/skhade007/localrepo.git #connection establish local and remote.
 git remote -v #to check remote
                    origin  https://github.com/skhade007/localrepo.git (fetch)
                    origin  https://github.com/skhade007/localrepo.git (push)
 

git branch #to check which branch
  * master
git branch -M main #rename  master branch main because hub branch name is also main thats why we can also try to master but that tym hub name also changed as amaster.
 git branch        
  * main
git push origin main #######data sucessfully save in hub repo########
after that we can also create new file in that folder and try to push successfully(ex: create one file in same folder and try to push in hub)

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
assigmnt2:create branches and try to merge hub and local:
git branch feature1 #create one branch and here data is same as main branch also use #git checkout -b feature1 #create and automatically navigate.
  feature1
git checkout feature1 #go to feature1 branch
git branch
  * feature1
  main
# current branch not deleted,first checkout the another branch then delete(create one feature2 branch and try to delete as mention below)
git branch -d feature2 #featrue2 branch deleted
git branch
  * feature1
    main
do changes on feature1 branch # then we can change branch main and see there is no data available as feature branch.
git status
git add and commit.
git push origin feature1 # push this branch to hub
#here is hub shows feature and main branch and now try to merge on hub first
git branch
  * feature1
    main
git diff main #see difrence in branches,when we are in feature1 branch that tym is run

Two ways to merge: for hub merge branches using PR(pull request)
 1)#try to merge in github using compare and pull request option then pull on local machine,after pull/merge both branch data is same.
#in hub both branch are merge after the PR but local machine still both branch not merge 
git pull origin main #remote changes on local machie
2)git branch
* feature1
    main
git merge main# used to merge branches in local mashine and then oush on hub.
